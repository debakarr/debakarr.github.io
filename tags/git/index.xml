    <description><![CDATA[Deleting stale git branches Working on monolithic projects with a large team of developers often leads to an accumulation of stale git branches. These branches may be left behind due to unresolved merge conflicts, abandoned tasks, or even employee turnover. Over time, this can result in repositories with thousands of inactive branches, potentially affecting your CI/CD process and increasing the time taken for git clone operations. To address this, we can implement a process to identify and delete stale branches that have been inactive for a certain period, say 120 days.]]></description>
